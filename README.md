Collecting workspace information# LLM Cybersecurity Assistant

A Streamlit-based cybersecurity assistant that combines phishing detection and question-answering capabilities using fine-tuned language models.

## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Dual-Mode Operation
- **Phishing Detection Mode**: Analyzes emails, URLs, and messages to identify phishing attempts
- **Q&A Mode**: Answers cybersecurity questions with context from web search

### ü§ñ Multi-Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: Llama 3.1 8B for mode determination
- **Q&A Model**: Llama 3.1 ChatQA for answering questions
- **Phishing Detection**: Fine-tuned Gemma 1B for phishing classification

### üîç Intelligent Features
- Automatic mode detection based on user intent
- Web search integration for contextual Q&A responses
- BM25 retrieval system for similar email matching
- Real-time conversation tracking with Langfuse

## How It Works

### Mode Detection
The system automatically determines whether a user query is:
- **Phishing Detection**: When users provide specific text (email, URL, message) for analysis
- **Q&A**: When users ask general questions about cybersecurity

### Phishing Detection Pipeline
1. Analyzes user-provided content (emails, URLs, messages)
2. Retrieves similar emails from the database using `find_similar_emails`
3. Uses fine-tuned Gemma model via `classify_phishing_pretrained` for classification
4. Returns detailed evaluation with reasoning and explanation

### Q&A Pipeline
1. Performs web search using `search_and_fetch_contents`
2. Generates contextual responses using `answer_question`
3. Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Set up environment variables in .env:
```env
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

3. Initialize the BM25 retriever and embedding models

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Example Queries

**Phishing Detection:**
```
Is this email safe?
"""
From: domain@domain-name.com
To: Your email
Subject: Apple Facetime Information Disclosure

[National Security Department logo]

National Security Department
A vulnerability has been identified in the Apple Facetime mobile applications that allow an attacker to record calls and videos from your mobile device without your knowledge.

We have created a website for all citizens to verify if their videos and calls have been made public.

To perform the verification, please use the following link: [Facetime Verification] (yellow button)

This website will be available for 72 hours.
