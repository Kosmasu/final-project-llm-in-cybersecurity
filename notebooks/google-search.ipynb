      "Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information[1] or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates the site, and transverses any additional security boundaries with the victim.[2] As of 2020, it is the most common type of cybercrime, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of cybercrime.[3]\n",

      "Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials. Most attacks are \"bulk attacks\" that are not targeted and are instead sent in bulk to a wide audience.[12] The goal of the attacker can vary, with common targets including financial institutions, email and cloud productivity providers, and streaming services.[13] The stolen information or access may be used to steal money, install malware, or spear phish others within the target organization.[14] Compromised streaming service accounts may also be sold on darknet markets.[15]\n",

It often utilizes personal information about the target to increase the chances of success.[17][18][19][20] These attacks often target executives or those in financial departments with access to sensitive financial data and services. Accountancy and audit firms are particularly vulnerable to spear phishing due to the value of the information their employees have access to.[21]\n",

The attackers spoof the calling phone number to appear as if it is coming from a legitimate bank or institution. The victim is then prompted to enter sensitive information or connected to a live person who uses social engineering tactics to obtain information.[25] Vishing takes advantage of the public's lower awareness and trust in voice telephony compared to email phishing.[26]\n",

      "\n",
      "In \"quishing\" (QR code phishing), scammers exploit the convenience of QR codes to trick users into giving up sensitive data, by scanning a code containing an embedded malicious web site link. Unlike traditional phishing, which relies on deceptive emails or websites, quishing uses QR codes to bypass email filters[34][35] and increase the likelihood that victims will fall for the scam, as people tend to trust QR codes and may not scrutinize them as carefully as a URL or email link. The bogus codes may be sent by email, social media, or in some cases hard copy stickers are placed over legitimate QR codes on such things as advertising posters and car park notices.[36][37] When victims scan the QR code with their phone or device, they are redirected to a fake website designed to steal personal information, login credentials, or financial details.[34]\n",

      "Traditional phishing attacks are typically limited to capturing user credentials directly inputted into fraudulent websites. However, the advent of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing techniques has significantly advanced the sophistication of these attacks, enabling cybercriminals to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms during a user's active session on a web service. MitM phishing attacks employ intermediary tools that intercept communication between the user and the legitimate service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evilginx, originally created as an open-source tool for penetration testing and ethical hacking, has been repurposed by cybercriminals for MitM attacks. Evilginx works like a middleman, passing information between the victim and the real website without saving passwords or login codes. This makes it harder for security systems to detect, since they usually look for phishing sites that store stolen data. By grabbing login tokens and session cookies instantly, attackers can break into accounts and use them just like the real user, for as long as the session stays active.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attackers employ various methods, including phishing emails, social engineering tactics, or distributing malicious links via social media platforms. Once the victim interacts with the counterfeit site, the MitM tool intercepts the authentication process, effectively bypassing 2FA protections.[39]\n",

      "\n",
      "Phishing attacks often involve creating fake links that appear to be from a legitimate organization.[40] These links may use misspelled URLs or subdomains to deceive the user. In the following example URL, http://www.yourbank.example.com/ , it can appear to the untrained eye as though the URL will take the user to the example section of the yourbank website; this URL points to the \"yourbank\" (i.e. phishing subdomain) section of the example website (fraudster's domain name). Another tactic is to make the displayed text for a link appear trustworthy, while the actual link goes to the phisher's site. To check the destination of a link, many email clients and web browsers will show the URL in the status bar when the mouse is hovering over it. However, some phishers may be able to bypass this security measure.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Internationalized domain names (IDNs) can be exploited via IDN spoofing[42] or homograph attacks[43] to allow attackers to create fake websites with visually identical addresses to legitimate ones. These attacks have been used by phishers to disguise malicious URLs using open URL redirectors on trusted websites.[44][45][46] An example of this is in http://www.exаmple.com/ , where the third character is not the Latin letter 'a', but instead the Cyrillic character 'а'. When the victim clicks on the link, unaware that the third character is actually the Cyrillic letter 'а', they get redirected to the malicious site http://www.xn--exmple-4nf.com/ Even digital certificates, such as SSL, may not protect against these attacks as phishers can purchase valid certificates and alter content to mimic genuine websites or host phishing sites without SSL.[47]\n",

The term \"phishing\" is said to have been coined by Khan C. Smith, a well-known spammer and hacker,[52] and its first recorded mention was found in the hacking tool AOHell, which was released in 1994. AOHell allowed hackers to impersonate AOL staff and send instant messages to victims asking them to reveal their passwords.[53][54] In response, AOL implemented measures to prevent phishing and eventually shut down the warez scene on their platform.[55][56]\n",

In August 2013, Outbrain suffered a spear-phishing attack,[73] and in November 2013, 110 million customer and credit card records were stolen from Target customers through a phished subcontractor account.[74] CEO and IT security staff subsequently fired.[75] In August 2014, iCloud leaks of celebrity photos were based on phishing e-mails sent to victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google.[76] In November 2014, phishing attacks on ICANN gained administrative access to the Centralized Zone Data System; also gained was data about users in the system - and access to ICANN's public Governmental Advisory Committee wiki, blog, and whois information portal.[77] Fancy Bear was linked to spear-phishing attacks against the Pentagon email system in August 2015,[78][79] and the group used a zero-day exploit of Java in a spear-phishing attack on the White House and NATO.[80][81] Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016.[82][83] In August 2016, members of the Bundestag and political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union, and the CDU of Saarland were targeted by spear-phishing attacks suspected to be carried out by Fancy Bear. In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA, but consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear.[84][85][86] In 2017, 76% of organizations experienced phishing attacks, with nearly half of the information security professionals surveyed reporting an increase from 2016. In the first half of 2017, businesses and residents of Qatar were hit with over 93,570 phishing events in a three-month span.[87] In August 2017, customers of Amazon faced the Amazon Prime Day phishing attack, when hackers sent out seemingly legitimate deals to customers of Amazon. When Amazon's customers attempted to make purchases using the \"deals\", the transaction would not be completed, prompting the retailer's customers to input data that could be compromised and stolen.[88] In 2018, the company block.one, which developed the EOS.IO blockchain, was attacked by a phishing group who sent phishing emails to all customers aimed at intercepting the user's cryptocurrency wallet key, and a later attack targeted airdrop tokens.[89]\n",

Posing as helpdesk staff, they called multiple Twitter employees, directing them to submit their credentials to the fake VPN website.[90] Using the details supplied by the unsuspecting employees, they were able to seize control of several high-profile user accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, and Apple Inc.'s company account. The hackers then sent messages to Twitter followers soliciting Bitcoin, promising to double the transaction value in return. The hackers collected 12.86 BTC (about $117,000 at the time).[91] In the 2020s, phishing as a service (PhaaS) platforms like Darcula allow attackers to easily fake trusted websites.[92]\n",

However it is unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate,[102] and some studies have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks;[103] which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.\n",

Opera 9.1 uses live blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns about privacy.[117] According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.[118]\n",

Users of the bank's online services were instructed to enter a password only when they saw the image they selected. The bank has since discontinued the use of SiteKey. Several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent.[124][125] In addition, this feature (like other forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005,[126] and Citibank in 2006.[127]\n",

      "Security skins[129][130] are a related technique that involves overlaying a user-selected image onto the login form as a visual cue that the form is legitimate. Unlike the website-based image schemes, however, the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the website. The scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.\n",

      "Still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.[131]\n",

A phishing kingpin, Valdir Paulo de Almeida, was arrested in Brazil for leading one of the largest phishing crime rings, which in two years stole between US$18 million and US$37 million.[141] UK authorities jailed two men in June 2005 for their role in a phishing scam,[142] in a case connected to the U.S. Secret Service Operation Firewall, which targeted notorious \"carder\" websites.[143] In 2006, Japanese police arrested eight people for creating fake Yahoo Japan websites, netting themselves ¥100 million (US$870,000)[144] and the FBI detained a gang of sixteen in the U.S. and Europe in Operation Cardkeeper.[145]\n",

      "Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 to Congress in the United States on March 1, 2005. This bill aimed to impose fines of up to $250,000 and prison sentences of up to five years on criminals who used fake websites and emails to defraud consumers.[146] In the UK, the Fraud Act 2006[147] introduced a general offense of fraud punishable by up to ten years in prison and prohibited the development or possession of phishing kits with the intention of committing fraud.[148]\n",

      "Companies have also joined the effort to crack down on phishing. On March 31, 2005, Microsoft filed 117 federal lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The lawsuits accuse \"John Doe\" defendants of obtaining passwords and confidential information. March 2005 also saw a partnership between Microsoft and the Australian government teaching law enforcement officials how to combat various cyber crimes, including phishing.[149] Microsoft announced a planned further 100 lawsuits outside the U.S. in March 2006,[150] followed by the commencement, as of November 2006, of 129 lawsuits mixing criminal and civil actions.[151] AOL reinforced its efforts against phishing[152] in early 2006 with three lawsuits[153] seeking a total of US$18 million under the 2005 amendments to the Virginia Computer Crimes Act,[154][155] and Earthlink has joined in by helping to identify six men subsequently charged with phishing fraud in Connecticut.[156]\n",

      "In January 2007, Jeffrey Brett Goodin of California became the first defendant convicted by a jury under the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was found guilty of sending thousands of emails to AOL users, while posing as the company's billing department, which prompted customers to submit personal and credit card information. Facing a possible 101 years in prison for the CAN-SPAM violation and ten other counts including wire fraud, the unauthorized use of credit cards, and the misuse of AOL's trademark, he was sentenced to serve 70 months. Goodin had been in custody since failing to appear for an earlier court hearing and began serving his prison term immediately.[157][158][159][160]\n",
